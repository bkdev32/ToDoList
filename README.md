# ToDoList

I developed this app mainly as a personal challenge for fun! After I finished working on [Done](https://github.com/bkdev32/Done), I thought playing around with TableView further while sticking to Apple's own ecosystem could be fun.

This is a very simple To-Do List app that allows users to have multiple lists/categories. 

Each item can be marked as done or simply deleted by swiping to left. 

I have created the same app using Realm and various pods such as SwipeCellKit. It can be accessed [here](https://github.com/bkdev32/Done).
